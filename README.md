# FOASP - A small library to scrape ASP.Net generated pages

Scraping is fun - however some wierd consultants (hired by governments)
like to create pages with ASP.Net. These pages feature quite some oddities
- since requests are cobbled together using javascript and the whole site
relies on a lot of POST requests.

This makes these kind of sites a nightmare to scrape. FOASP is my try to
tackle the nightmare of ASP.NET sites.
